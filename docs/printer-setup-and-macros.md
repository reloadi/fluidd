# Printer setup & macros

Fluidd requires some basic configuration to applied in order to function correctly. Fluidd should warn you if these are not found in your configuration upon startup.

## Configuration
You can also include this in your printer.cfg with `[include client.cfg]`

### [virtual_sdcard]
Fluidd requires your printer be setup with `virtual_sdcard`. This allows file uploads to work correctly. If you get a geodes path not found error in Fluidd this is generally the first place to look.
```yml
[virtual_sdcard]
path: ~/gcode_files
```

### [display_status]
Required to properly support display updates in fluidd- with no other lines required.
```yml
[display_status]
```

### [pause_resume]
Enables Pause / Resume functionality within klipper. This is a single block, with no other lines required.
```yml
[pause_resume]
```

## Macros
These can be assumed sane defaults, but should be checked and modified to your own needs.

You can also include this with `[include client_macros.cfg]` in your printer.cfg
